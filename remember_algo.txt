1. convert to gray with cv2.cvtColor
2. use opencv harris filter with settings 3,3,0.04
3. view hist with np.histogram and set threshold, used 0.002
4. Use scipy.ndimage.measure.label to label the clusters. This returns
an image with each pixel having a value corresponding to the cluster and
also the number of clusters found.
